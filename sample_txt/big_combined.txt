Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do.
Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.
'And what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'

that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
